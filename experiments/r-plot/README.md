# Coverage chats in R

This R code will produce coverage & time graphs, as used in the following paper:

There is one subplot per domain. Each planner shows the coverage % in the domain, and the average time on top of scatter plot of each instance.

## Setup

The script requires R.

First make sure you install R-packages [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) and [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) packages. You can do this from command line once:

```shell
$ Rscript -e 'install.packages("dplyr")'
$ Rscript -e 'install.packages("ggplot2")'
```

## Generating plots

First, prepare the CSV file; see template example in [results.csv](results.csv). You can change the file to read from in `plot.R` line:

```R
# read the csv
df = read.csv("./results.csv")
```

Then, you can use [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) or simply from command line run:

```shell
$ R < plots.R --no-save
```
